player CreateDiaryRecord ["Diary",["Ammunition","Ammunition can be spawned by squadleaders, teamleaders and 2IC's from the spawner stand. Statics can be spawned by any member of the Fire Support Team. The spawner has a cooldown period, which gets shorter as more players join the session. This can be seen, as well as any box-specific restrictions, by selecting the box from the spawner and reading the hint provided. If the spawner is on cooldown, you can leave the spawner and it will notify you remotely when it is available again."]];
